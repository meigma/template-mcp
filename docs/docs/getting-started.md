# Getting started

This tutorial takes you from a fresh clone to a running MCP server over both
transports. It assumes nothing beyond a terminal.

## Install prerequisites

The toolchain is provisioned by [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) and
orchestrated by [Moon](https://moonrepo.dev/moon). Install both, then let proto
install the pinned Go and lint toolchains:

```sh
# Install proto (which can also manage moon and the Go toolchain).
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh | bash

# Install moon.
proto install moon

# From the repository root: provision the pinned tools (Go, golangci-lint, moon).
proto install
```

Building the documentation also needs Python and uv; proto installs both from
the pinned versions when you run the docs tasks.

## Run over STDIO

The STDIO transport is what a local MCP client launches as a subprocess:

```sh
go run ./cmd/template-mcp stdio
```

The process speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout and blocks until
the client closes the input stream or the process is signaled. That is expected:
it is a server, not a one-shot command. Diagnostics go to stderr; stdout carries
only protocol messages.

## Run over Streamable HTTP

The HTTP transport suits networked or containerized deployments. It binds
loopback by default:

```sh
go run ./cmd/template-mcp http --addr localhost:8080
```

You will see a `listening` log line on stderr. Press `Ctrl-C` for a graceful
shutdown.

## Call the demo tool

Both transports serve the same server, which registers one tool, `random_int`.
It takes `min` and `max` and returns a uniformly random integer in the inclusive
range `[min, max]`, or a tool-level error if `min > max`. Point your MCP client
at the server and call `random_int` to see structured output.

## Run the checks

Moon is the task front door:

```sh
moon run root:build
moon run root:test
moon run root:check   # format, lint, build, test, docs build, and the proxy checks
```

## Next steps

- [Add a tool](add-a-tool.md) of your own.
- Review the [configuration](configuration.md) reference.
- Read the [security](security.md) model before exposing the HTTP transport.
